# scala
MSc CS, PPL Scala assignment 2015

This programme encodes plain text using the Playfair cipher. It also decodes enciphered text back into the original text. Text is encoded and decoded using a keyword. For all of the test files in the test package, the keyword is *Pennsylvania*. To run the programme compile the Code and Playfair files and run the Playfair class, which has a ```main``` method. You will then be presented with text options on how to proceed. 

If you want to run the tests, you need to use Scalatest 2.10.
